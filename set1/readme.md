TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week, I got introduced to code- setting up Github, VS code, downloading Python. This is all very new to me as I have never coded before or had any prior experiences with coding. I'm still confused about the concepts of coding eg. tests, coding jargon and the computer controls.
